Hi, you and your computer are going to play a game of blackjack. In Blackjack, the one who has the sum of cards that is the closest to 21 will win, but attention, if the sum of your card numbers is over 21, one will automatically lose.

During the first round, you get one card. If you want another card, you will choose to hit, if you don't want anymore cards, you will choose to stand. The game will keep on until both players choose to stand or one goes over 21.

Example:
If you get a random card which has the number 5 and you choose to hit, You'll get another random card number, which can be 9. At this point, the sum of my cards will be 9+5=14. If I choose to stand, then my final number will be 14, and the computer will start to play. Say the computer gets a total of 6+2+8=16, then the computer wins, because it's closer to 21. However, if the computer's final number is over 21 or further from 21 than me, I will win.
